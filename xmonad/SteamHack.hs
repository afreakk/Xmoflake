-- Module      :  XMonad.Hooks.FloatConfigureReq
-- Description :  Customize handling of floating windows' move\/resize\/restack requests (ConfigureRequest).

--
-- xmonad normally honours those requests by doing exactly what the client
-- application asked, and refreshing. There are some misbehaving clients,
-- however, that:
--
-- * try to move their window to the last known absolute position regardless
--   of the current xrandr/xinerama layout
--
-- * move their window to 0, 0 for no particular reason (e.g. rxvt-unicode)
--
-- * issue lots of no-op requests causing flickering (e.g. Steam)
--
-- This module provides a replacement handler for 'ConfigureRequestEvent' to
-- work around such misbehaviours.

-- $usage
-- To use this, include the following in your @xmonad.hs@:
--
-- > import XMonad.Hooks.FloatConfigureReq
-- > import XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers
--
-- > myFloatConfReqHook :: MaybeMaybeManageHook
-- > myFloatConfReqHook = composeAll
-- >     [ … ]
--
-- > myEventHook :: Event -> X All
-- > myEventHook = mconcat
-- >     [ …
-- >     , floatConfReqHook myFloatConfReqHook
-- >     , … ]
--
-- > main = xmonad $ …
-- >               $ def{ handleEventHook = myEventHook
-- >                    , … }
--
-- Then fill the @myFloatConfReqHook@ with whatever custom rules you need.
--
-- As an example, the following will prevent rxvt-unicode from moving its
-- (floating) window to 0, 0 after a font change but still ensure its size
-- increment hints are respected:
--
-- > className =? "URxvt" -?> pure <$> doFloat
--
-- Another example that avoids flickering and xmonad slowdowns caused by the
-- Steam client (completely ignore all its requests, none of which are
-- meaningful in the context of a tiling WM):
--
-- > map toLower `fmap` className =? "steam" -?> mempty
--
-- (this example is also available as 'fixSteamFlickerMMMH' to be added to
-- one's @myFloatConfReqHook@ and also 'fixSteamFlicker' to be added directly
-- to one's 'handleEventHook')

-- | A variant of 'MaybeManageHook' that additionally may or may not make
-- changes to the 'WindowSet'.
type MaybeMaybeManageHook = Query (Maybe (Maybe (Endo WindowSet)))

-- | Customizable handler for a 'ConfigureRequestEvent'. If the event's
-- 'ev_window' is a managed floating window, the provided
-- 'MaybeMaybeManageHook' is consulted and its result interpreted as follows:
--
--  * @Nothing@ - no match, fall back to the default handler
--
--  * @Just Nothing@ - match but ignore, no refresh, just send ConfigureNotify
--
--  * @Just (Just a)@ - match, modify 'WindowSet', refresh, send ConfigureNotify
